# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-PROJECT

THIS IS MINE FIRST MACHINE LEARNING HACKATHON PROJECT WHERE WE HAVE CREATED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION.


Problem definition/statement:

With the penetration of social media our country is fighting a fake news pandemic. So some brave volunteers took upon the challenge and compiled a list of real and fake news of the past. Now it's your responsibility to create an AI model that can predict if a news is real or fake before it goes viral in social media.

About the Dataset:

1. id: unique id for a news article
2. title: the title of a news article
3. author: author of the news article
4. text: the text of the article, could be incomplete
5.  label: a label that marks whether the news article is real or fake:

1: Fake news

0: real News


This notebook looks into various Python based ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether news is true or false based on given attributes.

We're going to take following approach :

1. Problem definition/statement
2. Importing Necessary libraries & tools
3. Data loading & cleaning
4. Data Preprocessing
5. modelling
